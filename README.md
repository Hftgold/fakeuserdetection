It is difficult to determine the authenticity of an Instagram account with complete certainty. 
However, it is possible to build a model that can predict the likelihood that an Instagram account is fake, based on certain characteristics of the account and its activity.

Some possible characteristics that could be used as input features for a fake Instagram account detection model include:

The number of followers the account has

The ratio of followers to following

The age of the account

The amount of activity on the account (e.g. number of posts, comments, likes)

The type of content that is posted

The use of hashtags

The presence of a profile picture and biography

The use of third-party apps to boost the account's activity

Using these and other relevant features, it is possible to train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood that an Instagram account is fake.
However, it is important to note that building an accurate fake Instagram account detection model would likely require a large and diverse dataset of real and fake accounts, as well as careful feature engineering and model selection. 
It would also be important to continuously update the model as fake accounts evolve and change over time.
